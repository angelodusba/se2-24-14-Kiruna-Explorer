We opt for a preventive approach based on the Visual Studio Code extension by SonarQube called SonarLint directly connected to our organization on SonarQube. This extension allows us to fix issues directly during the development phase. Our approach provides for fixing eventual high severity issues or security related issues during the development. The other issues will be solved during development only on a voluntary basis. In addition, our strategy includes a check on SonarQube every time a story is finished and some refactoring at the beginning of each sprint in order to address other relevant problems.
